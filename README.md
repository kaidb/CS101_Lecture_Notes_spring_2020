# Intro to CS

## What is this class?
A crash course in python, a bird's eye view of various CS concepts as well as a sampling of applications.

## Who is this course for?
Anybody (and everyone!) who would like an introduction to programming in python, and a taste of what is out there with respect to applications of CS. Students of all backgrounds can progress at their own pace via project based learning. This means students with a background in CS can do a deep dive into advanced topics, and students just getting started can learn the fundamentals.

## What skills will you Develop?
While the course will be taught primarily in python, the purpose of this class is to develop foundational problem-solving skills by programming in Python. In particular, the skill should be transferable to other disciplines and programing languages.

## What is the minimal background a student needs to succeed?
While there are no formal requirements, students should be comfortable with concepts from a standard Algebra I course.

## What technology/devices are required for this class?
Any computer with an internet connection will suffice! Students are advised to have a computer running Windows/mac/Linux  in order to have their own personal development environment, but it is not required.
